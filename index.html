    <p>I am Brian Slonim, a student in 11th grade at CCA! This is my website for AP Computer Science Principles.  I play piano and ukelele and have a dog. I ran cross-country and track and field in middle school. My brother is an ice skater. I am learning how to use Bash, HTML, and GIT. I've already learned how to use Java and Python a little. Computer science is fun!</p>
